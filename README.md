# Tabs-Switing

This is a simple JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates how to create tab switching functionality using the DOMContentLoaded event and event delegation. When a user clicks on a tab, the corresponding tab content is displayed while hiding the others.


# Usage
Include the following HTML structure in your document:

index.html

Include the JavaScript code in a separate file, e.g., your-script.js:

script.js


# Explanation
This code implements tab switching functionality using event delegation. It listens for the 'DOMContentLoaded' event, ensures only one tab content is visible at a time, and toggles the visibility of tab content when a tab is clicked.

Feel free to customize and enhance this code to fit your specific needs.
